# Kotlin backend

Generated with spring boot kotlin starter kit

The idea is to:

- Get a microservice written in kotlin for managing users and roles.
- To be written using DDD
- To use cqrs
- To end up using graphql
- More to be defined

## Suggestions

I'm all open for suggestions. Learning Kotlin, Spring boot and applying DDD Hexagonal for first time, so if you see that
something can be better done, let me know.
